# request-ish
> `request`-ish interface with far fewer dependencies. Tiny footprint. Uses axios under the hood. No aftertaste.

## Getting started

```
$ npm install request-ish
```

## Usage

You can mostly do what `[request](https://github.com/request/request)` do. Except for when you can't.  Not anywhere near feature complete.

You probably don't want to use this yet.
